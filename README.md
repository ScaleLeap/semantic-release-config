===================================

[Semantic Release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) shareable config to publish NPM packages with [GitHub](https://github.com).

---

## Plugins

This shareable configuration uses the following plugins:

- [`@semantic-release/commit-analyzer`](https://github.com/semantic-release/commit-analyzer)
- [`@semantic-release/release-notes-generator`](https://github.com/semantic-release/release-notes-generator)
- [`@semantic-release/npm`](https://github.com/semantic-release/npm)
- [`@semantic-release/github`](https://github.com/semantic-release/github)
- [`@semantic-release/git`](https://github.com/semantic-release/git)

## Summary

- Provides an informative [git](https://github.com/semantic-release/git) commit message for the release commit that does not trigger continuous integration and conforms to the [conventional commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (e.g., "chore(release): 1.2.3 [skip ci]\n\nnotes").
- Creates a tarball that gets uploaded with each [GitHub release](https://github.com/semantic-release/github).
- Publishes the same tarball to [NPM](https://github.com/semantic-release/npm).
- Commits the version change in `package.json`.
- Creates or updates a [changelog](https://github.com/semantic-release/changelog) file.

## Download & Installation

```sh
$ npm i -D @scaleleap/semantic-release-config

## Usage

The shareable config can be configured in the [semantic-release configuration file](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/configuration.md#configuration):

```json
{
  "release": {
    "extends": "@scaleleap/semantic-release-config"
  }
}
```
